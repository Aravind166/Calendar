# Calendar
Hmmm ! This is Not That Much Complex Code But it saves Time If You're a C or C ++ Programmer , then you know displaying the calendar of a particular year is a tedious job. You would have to write at least 75 lines of code to do the job. But Python has a calendar Module with pre-defined functions which makes this task very-very simple . This program prints the calendar of an arbitrary year as entered by the user.


# Im saying because i think You can make anything Simple with python .
